ADF Data Structure
==================

col1  col2  col3
----------------
  v1    v2    v3
  v4    v5    v6
...

=>

{ 'col1': [v1, v4 ..],
  'col2': [v2, v5 ..],
  'col3': [v3, v6 ..]
}

A tabular structure with column headers col1, col2.. turns into a dictionary of
arrays. Each dictionary key represents a column and the value represents a list
of values v1, v4.. from the tabular structure. This data representation is
trivial to implement and has the added advantage of being efficient in both
projection and stepwise refinement of selection logic.
